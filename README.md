#### [PDF Table Extract](https://github.com/ashima/pdf-table-extract)  
PDF Table Extraction Utility. Analyses a page in a PDF looking for well delineated table cells, and extracts the text in each cell. Outputs include JSON, XML, and CSV lists of cell locations, shapes, and contents, and CSV and HTML versions of the tables. This utility is intended to be the first step in automatically processing data in tables from a PDF file, and was originally designed to read the tables in ST Microâ€™s datasheets. The script requires numpy and poppler (pdftoppm and pdftotext)
